This project implements a two-player Five-in-a-Row game, traditionally played with black and white stones on a 19x19 grid. The goal of the game is for one player to be the first to form an unbroken row of five stones, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Features:
Interactive Game Board: Local players take turns placing black and white stones on a 19x19 grid using a web-based interface.
Turn-Based Gameplay: The game alternates turns between the black and white teams, with the black team always starting first.
Win Detection: The game automatically detects when a player forms five stones in a row.
Score Tracking: A points system keeps track of how many games each team has won.
Game Reset: A reset button allows players to clear the board and start a new game.
